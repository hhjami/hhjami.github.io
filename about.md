I am an Assistant Professor in CSE, University of Dhaka. I am working as a Judge and Problem-setter in ICPC Dhaka Regional and other national level contests for more than 7 years. I had the honor of begin the Judging Director of ICPC Dhaka Regional 2019 hosted by SEU. I was also a judge in Asia West Final 2019. I was also the team leader of Bangladesh IOI team in 2014. I worked as the academic coordinator for NHSPC from 2015 to 2017. 

My best memory as a contestant was the championship in NCPC 2011. My team name was DU_Resonance and the members were Anna Fariha and Md. Shiplu Hawlader. Despite being very close multiple times, I never qualified for ICPC World Finals. But I coached teams from University of Dhaka and Jahangirnagar University who were able to make it to the World Finals. I am more proud of those achievements. 

I love my job at CSE, DU. I dream of having a education system in Bangladesh which will teach kids how to solve problems around them and make them empathetic. I am proud of my students. I am sure some day they will achieve my dream.
